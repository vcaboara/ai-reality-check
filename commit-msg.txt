[AI] fix: resolve Docker build issues for UI improvements

- Added tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.packages = ["src"] to pyproject.toml
- Updated .dockerignore to allow README.md (!README.md)
- Fixed import: src.analyzers.feasibility_analyzer
- Pass Path object (not string) to DomainConfig
- Included README.md in Dockerfile COPY statement

All features now working:
- Model display in header 
- Context input field 
- Multi-file upload 

Tested and verified functionality.
