    max: 50.0 # bar (high pressure gasification)

  residence_time:
    min: 0.1 # seconds (fast pyrolysis)
    max: 3600 # seconds (1 hour - slow pyrolysis/carbonization)

  heating_rate:
    min: 1 # °C/min (slow pyrolysis)
    max: 10000 # °C/s (flash pyrolysis)

# Validation rules
validation:
  mass_balance_tolerance: 0.05 # 5% acceptable deviation
  temperature_buffer: 50 # Celsius buffer for range checks

  # Common issues to flag
  warnings:
    high_temperature_without_pressure: 1200 # °C - flag if high temp but low pressure
    low_residence_time: 0.5 # seconds - may be insufficient
    high_residence_time: 7200 # seconds - may be impractical
